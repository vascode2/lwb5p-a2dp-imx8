This tutorial will show you how to integrate the LWB5+ Dongle on an i.MX 8M Plus DVK using Yocto with pulseAudio included. You can test A2DP by streaming music from a smartphone to LWB5+ on imx8 board or vice versa.

# Required Tools

-   [LWB5+ Dongle](https://www.ezurio.com/wireless-modules/wifi-modules-bluetooth/sterling-lwb5-plus-wifi-5-bluetooth-5-module) (Part No. 450-00137)
-   i.MX 8M Plus EVK (Part No. 8MPLUSLPD4-EVK)
-   Linux PC with a Yocto Build Environment. 
	As a prerequisite for this tutorial, we are going to assume that you know how to setup a Yocto build environment. This is covered very well in NXP's documentation ( i.e. see [i.MX_Yocto_Project_User's_Guide.pdf, Rev. L5.4.70_2.3.0 --- 31 December 2020](https://community.nxp.com/pwmxy87654/attachments/pwmxy87654/imx-processors/171785/1/i.MX_Yocto_Project_User's_Guide.pdf) for details on how to install the required *host packages* and the *repo utility*, and how to setup *git*); so we will not cover it here. We will focus on how to add Ezurio's external layer into a Yocto build.

# Setup

We will flash our image into a micro SD card. If you prefer, you can use the onboard eMMC, but for this tutorial. we will boot from a micro SD card. The LWB5+ Dongle will plug into J7. Power will be applied via J5, and J23 will be used to connect to a serial terminal (115200, N, 8, 1). If the build works, the drivers will automatically load on power up. We will then connect to an AP and do a ping to demonstrate that Wi-Fi works. Then, we will download audio file and test audio locally on imx8 first with pulseaudio. After that, we will connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth and stream music from a phone to LWB5+ so that we can hear it with earphone from imx8 plus EVK.

1.  Download the i.MX Yocto Project Community BSP recipe layers

    **Reminder:** Prior to proceeding, make sure the required host packages and repo utility are installed. Git must also be configured properly. Refer to [i.MX_Yocto_Project_User's_Guide.pdf, Rev. L5.4.70_2.3.0 --- 31 December 2020](https://community.nxp.com/pwmxy87654/attachments/pwmxy87654/imx-processors/171785/1/i.MX_Yocto_Project_User's_Guide.pdf) for details.

    ```
    mkdir ~/projects/imx8mp
    cd ~/projects/imx8mp
    repo init -u https://github.com/nxp-imx/imx-manifest -b imx-linux-kirkstone -m imx-5.15.32-2.0.0.xml && repo sync

    ```

2.  Setup build configuration

    ```
    DISTRO=fsl-imx-wayland MACHINE=imx8mpevk source imx-setup-release.sh -b build-imx8p-wayland

    ```

3.  Modify the *~/projects/imx8mp/build-imx8p-wayland/conf/bblayers.conf* file. Add the line below to the file.

    ```
    BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-summit-radio/meta-summit-radio"

    ```

    **Note:** for Yocto projects 3.3 (Hardknott) and earlier the line you add would be

    ```
    BBLAYERS += "${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-summit-radio/meta-summit-radio-pre-3.4"

    ```

4.  Modify the *~/projects/imx8mp/build-imx8p-wayland/conf/local.conf* file. Add the lines below to the file.

    ```
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant = "summit-supplicant-lwb"
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-cli = "summit-supplicant-lwb"
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-passphrase = "summit-supplicant-lwb"

    BBMASK += "\
        meta-summit-radio/meta-summit-radio/recipes-packages/openssl\
        meta-summit-radio/meta-summit-radio/recipes-packages/.*/.*openssl10.*\
        "

    PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wireless-regdb-static = "wireless-regdb"
    LWB_REGDOMAIN = "US"

    ```

    **Note:** for Yocto projects 3.3 (Hardknott) and earlier you would add:

    ```
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant = "summit-supplicant-lwb"
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-cli = "summit-supplicant-lwb"
    PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-passphrase = "summit-supplicant-lwb"

    BBMASK += "\
        meta-summit-radio/meta-summit-radio-pre-3.4/recipes-packages/openssl\
        meta-summit-radio/meta-summit-radio-pre-3.4/recipes-packages/.*/.*openssl10.*\
        "

    PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wireless-regdb-static = "wireless-regdb"
    LWB_REGDOMAIN = "US"
    ```

5.  Clone the meta-summit-radio layer into *~/projects/imx8mp/sources* directory

    ```
    cd ~/projects/imx8mp/sources
    git clone https://github.com/Ezurio/meta-summit-radio -b lrd-11.39.0.x
    ```

6.  Edit the *~/projects/imx8mp/sources/meta-summit-radio/meta-summit-radio/recipes-packages/images/sample-image-cp-lwb5plus.bb* recipe by replacing *lwb5plus-sdio-div-firmware* with *lwb5plus-usb-sa-firmware* and adding *laird-networkmanager*. Then save it as *mylwb5p-v11.bb*. A snippet of the saved file is shown below.

    ```
    IMAGE_INSTALL += "\
    iproute2\
    rng-tools\
    ca-certificates\
    tzdata\
    alsa-utils\
    htop\
    ethtool\
    iperf3\
    tcpdump\
    iw\
    kernel-module-lwb5p-backports-summit\
    lwb5plus-usb-sa-firmware\
    summit-supplicant-lwb \
    summit-supplicant-libs-lwb \
    summit-networkmanager-lwb \
    summit-networkmanager-lwb-nmcli \
    packagegroup-fsl-tools-audio \
    packagegroup-tools-bluetooth \
    bluez5 \
    pulseaudio \
    pulseaudio-module-dbus-protocol \ 
    pulseaudio-client-conf-sato \
    "
    ```

7.  Next go to the build directory and run menuconfig to configure the Kernel.

    ```
    cd ../build-imx8p-wayland
    bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel
    ```

	Backports will replace the Wireless and Bluetooth stack. 
	The CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK needs to be removed to allow for faster loading of the firmware at boot.
	
	Make the following modifications:
	
	**In the menuconfig use / to search for each of the below configuration parameters in all caps.**

	```	
	WLAN
	- deselect Device Drivers -> Network device support -> Wireless LAN
	
	CONFIG_BT
	- deselect Networking support -> Bluetooth subsystem support
	
	WIRELESS
	- deselect Networking support -> Wireless 
	
	
	CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK
	- deselect Device Drivers -> Generic Driver Options -> Firmware Loader 
	    -> Firmware loading Facility ->Force the firmware sysfs fallback mechanism when possible
	
	CONFIG_IMX_SDMA
	- set to module Device Drivers -> DMA Engine support -> i.MX SDMA support
	    -   Save your changes and exit menuconfig
	```
8.  Build the image

    ```
     bitbake mylwb5p-v11
    ```

9.  Flash image into SD card. 

	**Note:** for this particular tutorial, the SD card is on /dev/sda1. It may be different for your setup; so make sure that you change the command below per your setup.

    ```
     bzip2 -dc ~/projects/imx8mp/build-imx8p-wayland/tmp/deploy/images/imx8mpevk/mylwb5p-imx8mpevk.wic.bz2 | sudo dd bs=512K iflag=fullblock oflag=direct status=progress conv=fsync of=/dev/sda1

     sync
    ```

	Or alternatively, you can use balenaEtcher to burn wic image to sd card.

10. Connect EVK to Serial Terminal via J23 (115200, N, 8, 1). Note for this tutorial we use */dev/ttyUSB2* port to connect. Your Linux PC might use a different port. Boot device and login as *root*.

11. Create a Wi-Fi profile with nmcli and then test with ping after making a connection to that AP. Use the following format of commands if using WPA PSK.

    ```
     nmcli con add con-name "YourProfile" ifname wlan0 type wifi ssid "YourAP" wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk wifi-sec.psk "YourPassword"
     nmcli c u "YourProfile"
     ping www.google.com
    ```

12. List available audio output and choose the one for headphone on imx8plus EVK. In this example, we chose sink #2.
	``` 
	root@imx8mpevk:~# pactl list sinks
		Sink #0
	        State: SUSPENDED
	        Name: alsa_output.platform-sound-bt-sco.mono-fallback
	        Description: Built-in Audio Mono
	        Driver: module-alsa-card.c
	
		...
	
		Sink #1
	        State: SUSPENDED
	        Name: alsa_output.platform-sound-hdmi.stereo-fallback
	        Description: Built-in Audio Stereo
	        Driver: module-alsa-card.c
		...
	
		Sink #2
	        State: SUSPENDED
	        Name: alsa_output.platform-sound-wm8960.stereo-fallback
	        Description: Built-in Audio Stereo
	        Driver: module-alsa-card.c        
		...
	
		Sink #3
	        State: SUSPENDED
	        Name: alsa_output.platform-sound-xcvr.iec958-stereo
	        Description: Built-in Audio Digital Stereo (IEC958)
	        Driver: module-alsa-card.c
        
	root@imx8mpevk:~# pacmd set-default-sink 2 
        
	```

13. Download an audio file to test playing it out with aplay. You can choose your own audio file instead of the link below. 
	```
	wget https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~i101/SoundFiles/BabyElephantWalk60.wav 
	```

14. Play audio with the audio device name specified (-D) first. Then, play the audio to PulseAudio sound server which is prerequisite of BT audio streaming.
	```
	root@imx8mpevk:~# aplay -D sysdefault:CARD=wm8960audio BabyElephantWalk60.wav 
	Playing WAVE 'BabyElephantWalk60.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 22050 Hz, Mono
	
	root@imx8mpevk:~# aplay -D pulse BabyElephantWalk60.wav 
	Playing WAVE 'BabyElephantWalk60.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 22050 Hz, Mono
	```

15. Now it is ready to connect Bluetooth and stream audio sound. Enter *bluetoothctl* and power up Bluetooth radio and put it in discoverable mode. 
	```
	root@imx8mpevk:~# bluetoothctl
		Agent registered
		[CHG] Controller C0:EE:40:82:6A:53 Pairable: yes

	[bluetooth]# power on
		[CHG] Controller C0:EE:40:82:6A:53 Class: 0x00200000
		Changing power on succeeded
		[CHG] Controller C0:EE:40:82:6A:53 Powered: yes
	[bluetooth]# discoverable on
		Changing discoverable on succeeded
		[CHG] Controller C0:EE:40:82:6A:53 Discoverable: yes

	```

16. Then, scan from your smartphone to connect to the **imx8mpevk** device in the Bluetooth scan list under the Setting. Pair with numeric comparison and authorize services by typing **yes** on the terminal for imx8 EVK.
